  standard meta-kernel containing a SPK kernel, PCK kernel, and a 
	current leapseconds LSK kernel.

  Note that kernels are loaded in the order listed. Thus we
  need to list the highest priority kernel last.

  Leapseconds: LSK kernel
	ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/naif*.tls

	Planetary ephemeris: SPK kernel
	ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de*.bsp

  Orientation data for planets, natural satellites, the Sun, 
	and selected asteroids: PCK kernel
	ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/pck*.tpc

	Load the three kernel:

  KERNELS_TO_LOAD = (

        'DATAROOT/de440.bsp',
